I had the opportunity to attend the **Java Developer Meetup** in Bangalore, an event that brought together professionals and enthusiasts from the Java ecosystem. The meetup featured a lineup of experienced speakers who shared valuable insights into the evolving landscape of Java development, including concurrency models, modern language features, cloud-native architecture, and data access optimization.

## Session Highlights

### 1. Ashutosh Bhakare – Secure App Development with Google Cloud ADK

Ashutosh introduced **Google's Application Development Kit (ADK)** for Java developers and demonstrated how it simplifies the creation of secure, scalable, cloud-native applications. The live demo illustrated:

- Integrating authentication and authorization into Java apps  
- Best practices for deploying Java services on **Google Cloud Run**  
- Using ADK SDKs to enforce encryption and policy management  

His talk made it clear how Google Cloud tools are adapting to meet enterprise Java needs with robust security.

### 2. Sumanth K S – Modern Java Features You Should Be Using

Sumanth covered the evolution of Java, focusing on features introduced in recent versions (Java 17 to Java 21):

- `record` types for lightweight data carriers  
- `sealed` classes for better type hierarchies  
- Pattern matching with `instanceof`  
- Multiline `text blocks` and new `string templates`  

He showcased how these features reduce boilerplate code and make Java cleaner and more expressive.

### 3. Kapil Rijhwani – Project Loom and Virtual Threads

Kapil gave an in-depth explanation of **Project Loom**, focusing on:

- Limitations of traditional Java threads  
- Introduction to **Virtual Threads** and how they differ from platform threads  
- Code examples showing how thread pools can be replaced with lightweight concurrency  
- Benefits in scalability and responsiveness for high-load applications  

He demonstrated how developers can adopt Loom today using Java 21 preview features.

### 4. Sathish Kumar T – DIY Spring JDBC for Real-World Applications

Sathish delivered a practical talk about building a **Spring JDBC** solution from scratch without relying on heavy abstraction layers like Hibernate. Key points included:

- Designing clean, maintainable DAO layers  
- Improving performance using batch updates and row mappers  
- Reducing complexity while maintaining flexibility in data access  

It was a refreshing session for developers who prefer control over their persistence logic.

## Networking and Collaboration

Apart from the technical sessions, the meetup offered great opportunities to interact with developers from different backgrounds—startups, MNCs, and academia. We discussed:

- Migration strategies to Java 21  
- Adoption of microservices in Spring Boot  
- Real-world concurrency challenges  
- GCP vs AWS for enterprise Java workloads  

This face-to-face interaction added immense value to the experience.

## Final Thoughts

This meetup was a powerful reminder of how vibrant and future-ready the Java community is. With advancements like **Virtual Threads**, better **language ergonomics**, and **cloud-native tooling**, Java is evolving to meet modern development needs.

Whether you are a student, backend engineer, or software architect, events like these help you stay current, learn from real-world use cases, and get inspired to build better systems.
