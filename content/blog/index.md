Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to attend a vibrant **Java Meetup in Bangalore**, where developers, architects, and enthusiasts from across the region came together to share knowledge, innovations, and community spirit. The event was filled with powerful sessions, networking, and hands-on learning, offering valuable insights into modern Java development.

From cloud-native Java applications to concurrency patterns and Spring framework optimization, the topics covered were both **technically rich and practically applicable**. Here's a detailed glimpse into the key highlights from the event:

---

## Ashutosh S. Bhakare – Building Secure Apps on Google Cloud with ADK

Ashutosh delivered a crisp and practical workshop on **Google ADK (Application Development Kit)** using Java. Despite time constraints, he covered essential ADK components and walked participants through building a secure and scalable cloud-native application on **Google Cloud**.

His hands-on demos and clear explanations helped many developers understand how to integrate security into their Java apps using ADK.

## Sumanth K S – Modern Java: Best Practices and Evolving Features

Sumanth’s session was a walkthrough of **Java's recent features**, such as:

- `record` types  
- pattern matching (`instanceof`)  
- text blocks  
- string templates  
- sealed classes  

His focus on real-world examples made it easier to grasp **how these features improve code quality** and simplify development. The live coding was a great touch.

## Kapil Rijhwani – Project Loom & Virtual Threads

Kapil took us deep into **Project Loom** and its cornerstone: **Virtual Threads**.

From thread management to real-world concurrency patterns, he explained:

- Why traditional threads are resource-heavy  
- How Virtual Threads enable lightweight, scalable concurrency  
- Practical use cases and production-ready advice  

He balanced conceptual theory with strategies developers can start using immediately.

## Sathish Kumar Thiyagarajan – Real-World Spring JDBC (DIY Style)

Sathish brought strong energy with his session on **DIY Spring JDBC client** development.

He addressed two common pain points in using persistence frameworks and demonstrated how to:

- Cut through abstraction clutter  
- Solve real-world problems with a clean, maintainable JDBC approach  
- Achieve performance without complexity  

This session resonated well with developers looking for lightweight and flexible data access solutions.

## Key Takeaways

- Java’s new features significantly enhance clarity, maintainability, and development speed.
- Project Loom simplifies concurrency and improves application scalability.
- Spring’s extensibility allows developers to take more control over their codebase.
- Google ADK streamlines secure app development on the cloud using Java.
