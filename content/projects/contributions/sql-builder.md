SQL Builder is a lightweight native Java SQL client designed to simplify and streamline database operations. Unlike traditional ORMs like Spring JDBC or MyBatis, this tool provides a minimalistic, dependency-free approach using only core Java libraries, enabling fluent and efficient SQL query construction.

It supports multiple Java frameworks such as Spring Boot and Quarkus, making it versatile across a wide range of backend applications. Its design allows for clear, readable, and easily maintainable code, offering developers greater control over query execution and logic.

### Technologies Used

- *Core Development*: SQL Builder is built entirely with native **Java libraries**, ensuring no external dependencies and full transparency.
- *Framework Compatibility*: Compatible with modern Java frameworks like **Spring Boot** and **Quarkus**, providing integration flexibility for a wide variety of use cases.
- *Database Interaction*: It uses **JDBC** internally, wrapping database operations in a **fluent API** for intuitive query building, CRUD operations, auto-key retrieval, and custom mappers.
- *Code Simplification*: Emphasizes **method chaining** to reduce verbosity in query execution logic.
- *Deployment Ready*: Ideal for **microservices**, educational tools, or projects demanding high performance and simplicity without ORM complexity.

By focusing on readability, maintainability, and performance, SQL Builder becomes a powerful tool for developers who value control and minimalism in backend development.
