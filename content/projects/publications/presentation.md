Presented at **Dhanalakshmi Engineering College**, this paper demonstrated the design and development of a real-time hand gesture recognition system using **Artificial Intelligence** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.

The system enables touchless desktop control, providing a more intuitive and hygienic interaction methodâ€”especially relevant in environments where contactless control is essential. The project emphasizes accuracy, responsiveness, and user experience, simulating practical use cases like slide navigation, media control, and application switching.

Key highlights from the presentation:

- Implemented a CNN-based model to recognize predefined hand gestures.
- Focused on real-time performance using optimized image processing pipelines.
- Ensured robust gesture detection under various lighting and background conditions.
- Emphasized user accessibility and ease of deployment in desktop environments.

This innovation contributes to the growing field of **human-computer interaction**, enabling more natural, efficient, and hygienic control interfaces.
