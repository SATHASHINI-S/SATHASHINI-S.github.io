SQL Builder: Lightweight Native Java SQL Client
===============================================

### Project Summary

SQL Builder is a lightweight SQL client designed to simplify database operations in Java applications. It serves as a minimalistic alternative to heavier ORM tools like Spring JDBC and MyBatis, allowing developers to perform CRUD operations efficiently using a fluent and intuitive API. Built with native Java libraries, SQL Builder emphasizes clarity, speed, and framework independence.

### Why Use SQL Builder?

- Framework Independent: Compatible with any Java framework such as Spring Boot or Quarkus.
- Native Java: Built using only Java's standard librariesâ€”no external dependencies.
- Lightweight: Minimal overhead, ideal for microservices and high-performance systems.
- Simple: Offers a clear and fluent API for streamlined SQL operations.

### Goals

- Eliminate third-party dependencies for full native Java implementation.
- Improve readability with a fluent and expressive method-chaining syntax.
- Reduce configuration complexity commonly found in traditional ORM frameworks.

### Key Features

- Fluent API for building and executing SQL queries.
- Insert operations with support for multiple records.
- Ability to retrieve auto-generated keys after insertions.
- Single-record and multi-record selection using custom mappers.
- Built-in check for record existence.

### Use Cases

- Ideal for backend services requiring direct SQL access without the overhead of ORMs.
- Useful in small to mid-scale applications where simplicity and performance matter.
- Perfect for developers who prefer native Java code and full control over SQL queries.
- Suitable for educational projects, lightweight deployments, or proof-of-concept tools.
